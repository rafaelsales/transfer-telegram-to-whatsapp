# Feature Specification: Telegram to WhatsApp Chat Import CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-project-is`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This project is about a CLI tool that imports a telegram chat export (with text, files, photos, videos, voice messages) into Whatsapp using the whatsapp-web.js (https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) library. The telegram chat exports are folders created directly by Telegram. The entry point of a telegram chat export is a file called "result.json". This file contains the chat in JSON format and path references to the files, photos, videos, etc... A nice way to accomplish this goal is to split this task into two standalone commands via CLI: 1) read the telegram result.json and create a json file with the execution plan against whatsapp via whatsapp-web.js (the command + the text or path reference to the file); 2) read the whatsapp import plan and execute against whatsapp-web.js. This will allow the user to review the plan before executing it."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has exported their Telegram chat history (including text messages, files, photos, videos, and voice messages) and wants to import this data into WhatsApp. They need a safe, reviewable process that allows them to first generate an import plan and then execute it after review. The system should focus only on importing actual messages and media content, skipping group management actions and unsupported features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Telegram chat export folder with result.json, **When** user runs the plan generation command with the export folder path, **Then** system creates an output folder named "{input-folder}-WhatsAppExportOutput" containing the WhatsApp import plan file
2. **Given** a Telegram export with unsupported message types (service messages, group changes, polls), **When** user runs the plan generation command, **Then** system creates both an import plan and a skipped messages file named after the export folder
3. **Given** a valid WhatsApp import plan file, **When** user runs the execution command, **Then** system imports all messages and media to WhatsApp in correct chronological order
4. **Given** a partially completed import that was interrupted, **When** user runs the execution command again, **Then** system resumes from where it left off without duplicating already sent messages
5. **Given** an invalid or corrupted Telegram export, **When** user runs the plan generation command, **Then** system provides clear error messages indicating what's wrong
6. **Given** a WhatsApp import plan, **When** user reviews the plan before execution, **Then** user can see exactly what will be imported (message content, media files, timestamps)
7. **Given** an import execution with custom sleep parameter `--sleep 5-15`, **When** system sends messages, **Then** system waits a random time between 5-15 seconds between each send

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Telegram export contains unsupported message types (service messages, group management)?
- How does system handle missing media files referenced in result.json?
- What occurs when WhatsApp connection fails during import execution?
- How does system behave with very large chat exports (thousands of messages)?
- How does system handle poll messages and community features that are not supported by whatsapp-web.js?
- What happens if the import is interrupted (network failure, system crash) and restarted?
- How does the system behave with different sleep ranges (very short vs very long delays)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a Telegram export folder path as CLI input parameter
- **FR-002**: System MUST create output folder named "{input-folder-name}-WhatsAppExportOutput" in the same directory as the input folder
- **FR-003**: System MUST parse Telegram result.json files and extract all message data including text, timestamps, and media references
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a reviewable WhatsApp import plan in JSON format containing all planned actions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide two separate CLI commands - one for plan generation and one for plan execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve chronological order of messages during import
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle multiple media types (photos, videos, voice messages, files)
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate Telegram export structure before processing
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid inputs or connection failures
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to review the import plan before execution
- **FR-011**: System MUST connect to WhatsApp and execute the import plan when requested
- **FR-012**: System MUST skip service messages (group creation, title changes, member changes) and log them to a skipped messages file in the output folder
- **FR-013**: System MUST skip poll voting and community feature messages as they are unsupported by whatsapp-web.js
- **FR-014**: System MUST support text messages, photos, videos, voice messages, files, reactions, replies, and forwarded messages for WhatsApp import
- **FR-015**: System MUST track successfully sent messages in a progress file to enable idempotent execution
- **FR-016**: System MUST resume import from the last successful message when restarted, avoiding duplicate sends
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a `--sleep` parameter to configure random delay range between message sends (format: `--sleep MIN-MAX` in seconds)
- **FR-018**: System MUST use a default delay of 3-10 seconds between message sends when no `--sleep` parameter is provided

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Telegram Export Folder**: Input folder containing result.json and associated media files exported directly from Telegram
- **Output Folder**: Folder created in same directory as input, named "{input-folder-name}-WhatsAppExportOutput"
- **Import Plan**: A JSON file in the output folder containing structured commands and data for WhatsApp import execution
- **Skipped Messages File**: A JSON file in the output folder containing unsupported messages (service messages, polls, community features) that cannot be imported to WhatsApp
- **Progress Tracking File**: A file in the output folder that records successfully sent messages to enable resumable, idempotent imports
- **Message**: Individual chat message with text content, timestamp, sender, and optional media references
- **Media File**: Photos, videos, voice messages, documents referenced in the Telegram export
